This query has aged so well that I don't have a single memory of it. 
Judging from what I wrote, I meant to aggregate occurence of event "go to cart" on the hour of the day.
There must be other ways for the users to visit the shopping cart page. But "go to cart" is a specific feature. 
I bet it was my colleague who's a product designer that raised this question.
I loved working with product designers. I loved solving all their questions, big or small.
