Data scientists always felt like people way smarter beyond me. Because I know they know things I don't even know a hair about. 
Even if I dare say we all write SQL, this is the only time I solved something that my smart colleague didn't immediately solve at that moment.
It gave me a flicker of joy. 

The query was written to identify imcomplete product IDs in a dataset. The company I worked for does ecommerce. 
My colleague flagged that some of the ecommerce events(product detail views, add to cart, etc) had imcomplete values in the `product_id` field. 
The field looks like this: `BRAND NAME - product SKU`. The imcomplete values mostly containing the brand name only, either with or without '-'.
So I thought about excluding the case where SKUs properly showed up, as well as the `-`. That became the query below. 
I shared the query result with our developers, and within short they found out the reason why.  

The URL in the query is used to indicate the actual product, because it contains the sku. 

SELECT
(select value from unnest(hits.customdimensions) where index = 45) AS url,
 COUNT(prod.productSKU) AS occurrence,
 prod.productSKU AS product_sku,
 eCommerceAction.action_type
FROM
 `project.dataset.ga_sessions_*` AS ga,
 UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
 UNNEST(hits.product) AS prod
WHERE
 _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20220301' AND '20220308'
 AND NOT REGEXP_CONTAINS(prod.productSKU,'[\\d|-]')
GROUP BY
 product_sku, url, action_type
ORDER BY
 occurrence DESC, product_sku
