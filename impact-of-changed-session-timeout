I had this boss. Well, no words suffice to describe him.
At the company where I worked with him, the session timeout of Universal Analytics was set to the maximum of four hours, 
aiming at including as many conversions as possible.  
One day my boss asked me to change it to 30 minutes instead. And he was certain. 
And so I did. And another day he told me that our marketing department complained about the dropped conversion rate.
He asked me to look into how many the affected users were. And I wrote the query below. 
They were pretty many :) 

SELECT
 *
FROM (
 SELECT
   sid,
   MAX(time_until_next_hit) AS max_time_until_next
 FROM (
   SELECT
     sid,
     hit_number,
     TIMESTAMP_DIFF(TIMESTAMP(next_hit_timestamp), TIMESTAMP(hit_timestamp), MINUTE) AS time_until_next_hit
   FROM (
     SELECT
       sid,
       hit_timestamp,
       hit_number,
       LEAD(hit_timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY sid ORDER BY hit_number) AS next_hit_timestamp
     FROM (
       SELECT
         CONCAT(fullVisitorId, CAST(visitId AS STRING)) AS sid,
         h.hitNumber AS hit_number,
         TIMESTAMP_SECONDS(visitStartTime + CAST(h.time/1000 AS INT64)) AS hit_timestamp
       FROM
         `boozt-datalake.46041008.ga_sessions_*` AS ga,
         UNNEST(ga.hits) AS h
       WHERE
         _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN "20210513"
         AND "20210528"
       ORDER BY
         sid,
         hit_number ) ) )
 GROUP BY
   sid )
WHERE
 max_time_until_next > 30
 ORDER BY max_time_until_next DESC
