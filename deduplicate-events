  This query was created as a solution to a bizarre inflated event count in GA4. 
For every occurance of the event, 9 to 11 events of exactly the same kind would be sent. 
After trying everything I can in vain, I realised that I have to deduplicate the count afterwards. 

WITH
session_events AS
(
SELECT
  event_timestamp,
  (SELECT value.string_value FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'action') AS event_action,
  (SELECT CONCAT(user_pseudo_id, '.', value.int_value) FROM UNNEST(event_params) WHERE key = 'ga_session_id') AS session_id
FROM
  `your_dataset.events_*`
WHERE
  _TABLE_SUFFIX BETWEEN '20220920'AND '20220921'
  AND event_name = 'event_name'
),

deduplicated AS (
SELECT 
  session_id,
  event_timestamp
FROM
  session_events
WHERE
  event_action = "that_event_name_action"
QUALIFY
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(TIMESTAMP_MICROS(LEAD(event_timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY session_id ORDER BY event_timestamp)), TIMESTAMP_MICROS(event_timestamp), SECOND) > 1
)

SELECT * FROM deduplicated
